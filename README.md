# UFCpoundperpoundbest
UFC announcers often mention so and so as the best pound per pound fighter. I will crawl the UFC website to answer this question by calculating the win percentage per pound of weight to see who really is the "literal" the top 10 pound per pound fighters currently in the UFC Roster. This is the project for VIVA's Visual Analytics 101 course which I'm completing at UBC.
